              <strong>P.S.</strong> â€” I wasted three years trying to build authority the "organic" way. Posted daily, followed all the advice, got decent engagement. But prospects still saw me as "some consultant guy." The moment I had real Google credibility backing up quality content, everything changed. Inbound leads tripled. Speaking fees doubled. Partnerships started reaching out to me. This system works because it solves the real problem: Google decides who's credible, not LinkedIn likes.
